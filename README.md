# Racial Disparities in Police Stops in Chicago

Our research examines how the subject's race influences the likelihood of being stopped, searched,and arrested during a police stop in Chicago. We explore whether an officer's age impacts the stop's outcome and if specific violations increase the likelihood of a vehicle search and subjectâ€™s arrest. The project aims to uncover potential biases or systemic issues within policing practices in Chicago.

### SMART Questions:

Specific - Are there significant differences in the likelihood of being stopped, searched, and arrested during a police stop based on the subject's race, gender, and the officer's age, race, and gender?

Measurable - What is the magnitude of the racial disparities in police stops?

Achievable - Can we answer our questions with Stanford's open policing project dataset?

Relevant - Does understanding racial disparities in police stops in Chicago have practical
implications for improving policing practices and addressing racial inequities in the city?

Time Bound - Can this project be analyzed within a specified timeframe?

The data was collected from Stanford's Open Policing Project, where the dataset contains information on the location of stops, demographics of the subjects (including age, race, and gender), demographics of the officers (including age, race, and gender), the nature of the stop (whether vehicular or otherwise), the violation that prompted the stop, and whether an arrest occurred.
