## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df=read.csv("Chicago Police Stops.csv")
dim(df)
df
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
cat("Shape of data before removal",dim(df),"\n")

#Checking for missing values
cat("Missing values count:",sum(is.na(df)),"\n")

#Removal of missing values
df_cleaned<-na.omit(df)

#Checking of any missing values after removal
cat("Missing values after removal:",sum(is.na(df_cleaned)),"\n")

#Checking shape of the data after removing missing values
cat("Shape of data after removal",dim(df_cleaned))
df_cleaned
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
